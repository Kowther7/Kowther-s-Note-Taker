### ~ Express.js Challenge

## Description

**Purpose:**

In this challenge, we delved into the application of Express.js to construct a server, implement routers for a more organized backend structure, and establish connectivity between the server and the user interface.

**Project Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to reinforce our understanding of Express.js and to practice utilizing routes, managing files, and implementing a local database (JSON file).

**Problem Statement:**

This challenge addresses the need for a note-tracking solution, allowing users to access their notes seamlessly across multiple devices.

**Key Takeaways:**

I gained insights into building a server from the ground up, integrating it with a local database (JSON file), constructing routes for effective API management, and ultimately linking it to the UI to create a fully functional application.
